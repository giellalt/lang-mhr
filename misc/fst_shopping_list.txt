Some issues we still need to fix, beyond working our way down the list:

1) As regards alternation in connegative forms, see the new yaml file V-odd-stems.yaml

2) We definitely overshot the goal when allowing for е > ы shifts in word-final position. We do NOT want this change to happen in the following cases:

* No other vowels in word (e.g. шке, ме, те > шкеат, меат, теат)
* Words in ье (e.g. пятиборье > пятиборьеат) - but NOT кискалʼе (> кискалят) etc.
* Words were stressed vowel is о or у (e.g. караоке > караокеат)

3) Some oddities in the Lexicon:
* A lot of vowel harmony-violating forms from Finnish dictionary in there - коляшӱлье etc.
* ё became е in Finnish dictionary, thus сырьё became сырье > lots of problems

4) as regards alternation пу 'wood' > пун ~ пуын, пушто ~ пуышто, etc.

"-н after vowels. Unstressed final -е, -о, and -ӧ of the base word are reduced and become -ы.
In older sources, some alternation can be found in the case of monosyllabic stems ending
in -у, -ӱ, and -ю: here, a thematic -ы- occurred on occasion, e.g., ю ‘magic’ → юн ~ юын.
Modern stylistic guidelines discourage the usage of a thematic vowel here."
